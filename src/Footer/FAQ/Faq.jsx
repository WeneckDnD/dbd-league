            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Note: You may see security alerts since the timer listens for keystrokes in the
                    background. Some antivirus programs might flag it as malware because it doesn‚Äôt
                    have a certificate (they‚Äôre expensive). Don‚Äôt worry‚Äîthe project is open source and
                    the full code is available on GitHub.</em>
            </p>

            <h3>FAQ #6 - ACCOUNT WAS BANNED. WHAT DO I DO?</h3>
            <p>
                If your account (or your friend's account) got banned on DBDLeague, fill out the
                form here: ‚Å†‚ùó-unban-request. Reviews may take up to a few weeks.

                on Twitch. It will be reviewed by moderators.
            </p>

            <h3>FAQ #7 - HOW DOES 4v1 WORK?</h3>
            <p>
                In competitive 4v1 Dead by Daylight tournaments, each matchup is played in a
                mirrored format for fairness. First, the killer from Team A faces Team B‚Äôs
                survivors. Then, Team B‚Äôs killer faces Team A‚Äôs survivors.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both trials are held on the <strong>same map with the same killer</strong> to keep
                conditions equal. Teams are compared by completed generators, hook stages, and
                survivors hooked. The team with the stronger result wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event of a tie, the set is replayed or resolved using tie-breaker rules.
            </p>

            <h3>FAQ #8 - WHY ARE COMP PLAYERS CAMPING AND TUNNELING?</h3>
            <p>
                In competitive DBD, <strong>camping and tunneling</strong> are valid strategies
                because killers must play efficiently to keep up with top survivors.
            </p>
            <p>
                While disliked in casual play, in comp it‚Äôs often necessary to secure an early
                elimination against highly skilled teams. Survivors counter this with efficient
                gen rushing, body blocking, and coordinated perks.
            </p>
            <p>
                The dynamic between killers pushing for eliminations and survivors countering
                creates unique back-and-forth gameplay. Within comp, these tactics are generally
                <em>accepted as essential strategies</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>FAQ #9 - HOW CAN WE PARTICIPATE IN DBDLEAGUE?</h3>
            <p>
                There are several ways to join DBDLeague tournaments:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li>Respond to team applications posted by others.</li>

                <li>Join community or scrim nights to practice and get noticed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>

                required. Scrims and smaller tournaments are great entry points to build your
