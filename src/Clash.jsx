                <h3>How to Set Up a 1v1 Match</h3>
                <p><strong>1.1 Starting steps:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set your region role in ‚Å†üìú-ladder-region-role.</li>
                    <li>Killers are decided by the <em>picks and bans system</em>.</li>
                    <li>Only killers from the killer pool can be played (unless both players agree otherwise).</li>
                    <li>You must ban killers you do not own. If your opponent picks one, you forfeit that round.</li>
                    <li>Matches are played under the <strong>current balancing ruleset</strong> (‚Å†üçÇseasonal-1v1-balance).</li>
                    <li>Both players should <em>record their matches</em> to resolve disputes.</li>
                    <li>Default format: <strong>Best of 3 (First to 2 wins)</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Use commands: <code>/challenge</code>, <code>/challenge cancel</code>, <code>!iwon</code>, <code>!ilost</code>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>1.2 Additional steps:</strong></p>

                </ul>

                <h3>1v1 Scoring and Basic Rules</h3>
                <p><strong>2.1 Scoring:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Score = total chase time.</li>
                    <li>If the result differs by less than 1 second, the set is replayed.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>2.2 Basic Rules:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players alternate between killer and survivor.</li>

                    <li>No map resources can be used before the chase starts.</li>
                    <li>No closing the hatch ‚Äì automatic forfeit.</li>
                    <li>Survivors must start at shack doors; killers nod to indicate readiness.</li>
                    <li>All killers must swing on start (Nurse blinks with no distance, Blight rushes into door frame and fatigues, Wraith starts uncloaked).</li>
                </ul>

                <p><em>Example:</em> Player 1 gets 1:30 as survivor. Player 2 gets 1:45 as survivor. Player 2 wins the round.</p>
